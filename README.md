## Planning Story

I personally have built a lot of good habits and throw many bad habits by tracking in small increments with satisfying rewards. 
I will be using many hide and show features of jquery and keep users to use app at ease.  when a habit is achieved, I want them to feel good about it. if they missed a habit task, then app would suggest smaller increments and goals.
